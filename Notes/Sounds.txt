Track Settings Type: 0x0B9EB87E
Binary file Type: 0x7B1ACFCD

Track Settings file:

XML with following properties in order:

Sample Rate - eg 32000
Unknown string - Always "Track"?

There is also a binary resource with the same instance id as the Track Settings file. Does not seem to contain audio data. Maybe references the actual sound resource?

These sounds should be loaded as AudioAssets so that they can be played like any other sound by TSAudioSource

Replacing the Track settings file with an MP3 triggers a GetSoundDefinition error

Replacing the binary file with an MP3 triggers a GetHitList error

0x7B1ACFCD Must be a HitList resource. Likely contains references to sounds.

Binary file 0x7B1ACFCD:

4 bytes: Always 56?
4 bytes: Count
For Count loop
	References to MP3/XA/etc audio assets
	4 bytes: Instance Lo
	4 bytes: Instance Hi
End loop


I wonder if the track settings file is optional? Seems odd to be able to override the sample rate and such when they're provided in the sounds themselves already.
